# High-contrast-grating-solver
Matlab code to solve the reflection and transmission coefficient of a plane wave incident onto a single layer of high contrast grating

A high contrast grating solver (HCG Solver) is developed to solve the reflection and transmission coefficient of a plane wave incident onto a single layer of high contrast grating (HCG). It uses plane waves and waveguide array modes as the eigen modes to expand the electromagnetic field outside and inside the HCG respectively. By matching the boundary conditions at the HCG input plane and output plane, the electromagnetic property of HCG can be solved.
Please refer to the HCG Solver User Guide pdf file for more information.
